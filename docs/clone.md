## DESCRIPTION

Clone endpoint is used to copy the cluster configuration without exposing any
sensitive detail. This endpoint is particularly useful when combined with
snapshot restores or database cloning features provided by most cloud providers.

Cloning a cluster will first use the source credentials to validate the connection
with clone endpoint and, if successful, will rotate the password for both root
and management user. All the other details are kept intact.
